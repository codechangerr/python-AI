everyone sorry for the confusion on the last respotory...

the package commands are pip install speech_recogniton, pip install pyttsx3, pip install gTTS, pip install pyaudio, pip install playsound, pip install wikipedia, pip install phonenumbers.

also before you run you dont need ctpyes so you can delete the import witch sould look like from ctpyes import odell
                                                                                            import ctypes
                                                                                           
command list is:

-write this down for today/tomorrow
-search
and many more so fell free to look at the code and see what you can do 

commands should look like 
-if "..." in text:
    ...
